# Exercise 1 - Area of a Room (Python)

# Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once the values have
# been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the
# width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message;
# either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.

# Solution:
# First i want to get the width and length of the room from the user
# Get the width of the room from the user
st = input("Enter the width of the room in meters: ")
try:
    width = float(st.replace(',', '.'))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a numerical value for the width, using a dot or comma as the decimal separator.")
    exit()

# Get the length of the room from the user
st = input("Enter the length of the room in meters: ")
try:
    length = float(st.replace(',', '.'))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a numerical value for the length, using a dot or comma as the decimal separator.")
    exit()

# Calculate the area of the room
area = width * length

# Display the area of the room
print(f"The area of the room is {area} square meters.")

# Two words are anagrams if they contain all of the same letters, but in a different order. For example,
# “evil” and “live” are anagrams because each contains one e, one i, one l, and one v. Create a
# program that reads two strings from the user, determines whether or not they are anagrams, and
# reports the result.

# A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”, “civic”, “level”
# and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words. Write a program that reads a string from the
# user and uses a loop to determines whether or not it is a palindrome. Display the result, including a
# meaningful output message.


# Solution:

def IsItAPalindrome():
    # Read the string from the user
    String = input("Enter a string: ").lower().replace(" ", "") # normalize the string
    # Check if String is actually a string
    if not String.isalpha():
        print("Invalid Input. Please enter a letters only (no numbers or special characters)")
        return
    # Initialize the variable to store the reverse of the string
    Reverse = ""
    # Loop through the string in reverse order
    for c in reversed(String):
        Reverse += c
    # Check if the string is a palindrome
    if Reverse == String:
        print(f"{String} is a palindrome")
    else:
        print(f"{String} is not a palindrome")

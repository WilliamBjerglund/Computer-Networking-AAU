# When writing out a list of items in English, one normally separates the items with commas. In
# addition, the word “and” is normally included before the last item, unless the list only contains one
# item. Consider the following four lists:
#                apples
#         apples, and oranges
#     apples, oranges, and bananas
# apples, oranges, bananas, and lemons
# Write a function that takes a list of strings as its only parameter. Your function should return a string
# that contains all of the items in the list formatted in the manner described previously as its only
# result. While the examples shown previously only include lists containing four elements or less, your
# function should behave correctly for lists of any length. Include a main program that reads several
# items from the user, formats them by calling your function, and then displays the result returned by
# the function.

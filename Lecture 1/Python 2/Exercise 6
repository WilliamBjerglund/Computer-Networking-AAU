# Write a function that determines whether or not a password is good. We will define a good
# password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at
# least one lowercase letter, and at least one number. Your function should return true if the
# password passed to it as its only parameter is good. Otherwise it should return false. Include a main
# program that reads a password from the user and reports whether or not it is good.

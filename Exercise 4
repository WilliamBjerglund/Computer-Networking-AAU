# Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters and returns the median value of those
# parameters as its result. Include a main program that reads three values from the user and displays
# their median.

# Solution:

def median_of_three(a, b, c):
    return (a + b + c) - min(a, b, c) - max(a, b, c)

def main():
    print("Enter three numbers:")
    num1 = float(input("First number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Second number: "))
    num3 = float(input("Third number: "))
    
    median = median_of_three(num1, num2, num3)
    print(f"The median of {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is {median}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
